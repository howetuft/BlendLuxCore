"""Conversion of Blender mesh objects into LuxCore scene meshes.

Entry points (called from export/__init__.py via the object cache):

- convert(): convert a single object, serially (viewport / live-update path).
- convert_objects(): batch entry point of the render-export pre-pass. Takes a
  list of jobs (obj, mesh_key, transform, is_viewport_render, use_instancing,
  share_points); returns a list of ExportedMesh aligned with the jobs.

Both run the same 3-phase pipeline per object:

1. extract_mesh_data() -- Blender API -> numpy arrays. Must run in the main
   thread (Blender data is not thread-safe); this is why convert_objects()
   extracts serially in the calling thread and only parallelizes phases 2+3.
2. compute_submeshes() -- the C++/TBB implementation in pyluxcore
   (compute_submeshes_c, GIL released): weld coincident points, split into
   varying-data islands (union-find over shared edges with matching UV/normal
   signatures, small-island merge), group triangles by (material, island) and
   gather the per-submesh payloads (points, triangles, normals, UV/color/alpha
   layers, creases, optional baked transform). With share_points=True all
   submeshes of an object share one welded point buffer (needed by the C++
   subdivision envelope); with False each submesh is compacted to the points
   it uses (saves memory on fragment-heavy meshes).
3. define_submeshes() -- build and insert the meshes into the LuxCore scene,
   batched via Scene.DefineMeshesExt when available (one GIL release + one
   mesh-def mutex acquisition per object), else one DefineMeshExt per submesh.
   The material slot of each triangle is passed as the constant triangle AOV
   MATERIAL_TRI_AOV_INDEX, which the C++ subdiv envelope builder reads to
   split the subdivided result back per material.

Threading model: convert_objects() runs phases 2+3 in a ThreadPoolExecutor of
DEFAULT_EXPORT_WORKERS threads (BLC_EXPORT_WORKERS overrides), keeping a
window of at most BLC_EXPORT_INFLIGHT extracted-but-not-yet-converted objects
(default: the pool size) to bound peak memory. pyluxcore serializes the scene
mesh mutations internally (mesh-def mutex) and releases the GIL around the
C++ work, so worker threads are safe. Per-mesh log lines are buffered and
printed by the main thread so they stay grouped by mesh.

Other knobs: BLC_FORCE_SHARE_POINTS=1, BLC_DEBUG_EXPORT=1, BLC_DEBUG_MESH=1,
BLC_TIME_STAGES=1 (per-stage timings in the log).
