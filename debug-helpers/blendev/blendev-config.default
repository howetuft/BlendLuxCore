PYMAJOR=3                                           # Python major version against which Blender is compiled
PYMINOR=11                                          # Python minor version against which Blender is compiled

REPO_PATH=/PATH/TO/LUXCORERENDER                    # The working (git) folders LuxCore/ and BlendLuxCore/ are assumed to be located INSIDE this.
BLENDER_PROGRAM_PATH=/PATH/TO/BLENDER               # Where different Blender versions live. May be a system path when installing using a package manager, may be custom when using portable installation.

# In case of problems, please check the usage of these variables in the main "blendev" script.

# Some assumptions are made about the local file structure:
# 1) BLENDER_PROGRAM_PATH points to a folder containing different Blender version in subfolders of the form
#    "blender-4.3.2-linux-x64"
# 2) Blender stores its config under ~/.config/blender/
#    This will not be the case e.g. when using a fully-portable runtime with the config in the executable folder.
# 3) The repositories LuxCore/ and BlendLuxCore/ are located in the same directory.
#    BlendLuxCore/ could be automatically inferred from this script. May have side-effects as well.
# 4) Only one major.minor version of Python is relevant across all versions of Blender.
#    This will eventually require an update
